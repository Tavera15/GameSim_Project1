# Week 2 - Platformer
# Game and Simulation II

## Assignment

1) A UI for your game using Unity's UI elements. This must include:

A title screen (make a new scene, with a canvas and text that says "MY AWESOME GAME"), with options for choosing a level (you can use buttons here).
A health bar for your player that decreases with the player's health (this should include a "bar" image as well as a numerical indicator). We'll add enemies next week, for now you can decrease health as the result of a button press for testing.
2) Animations for your player character using Mecanim. This needs to have:

States and animations for Idle, Walking/Running, and Falling (at the very least)
State transitions that make sense (walking changing to idle when not moving, for instance)
CHALLENGE PROBLEMS (optional):

Include an animation state for when the player jumps - this should transition smoothly to the falling animation
Add a "sprint" feature - when you hold down a button, move speed increases - and while sprinting, decrease a "stamina" bar
Add a double jump - and make sure it animates properly
