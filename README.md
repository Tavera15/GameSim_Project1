# Week 2 - Platformer
# Game and Simulation II

## Assignment
*Your assignment this week is to build a basic 3D platformer in Unity, using what you've learned today. Your player character should be able to move left, right, forward, and back, and be able to jump only when on the ground. Your scene should include your player character, as well as a few platforms to test out the controls.
