# Week 2 - Platformer
# Game and Simulation II

## Assignment

Your assignment for this week is to add the following to your platformer project:

1) An enemy that stands still, and when the player is close, should charge at the player. The enemy should be killed if the player jumps on it, and the score increased. 

2) An enemy that patrols a specific area, and when the player is close, should charge at the player.  The enemy should be killed if the player jumps on it, and the score increased.

(Both enemies should have animations for, at the very least, idle and running)

3) If the player is hit by an enemy, the player should take damage and their health should decrease. If the player runs out of health, the level should restart. The player should not take damage when jumping on top of an enemy to kill it.

4) Add a "KillY" line. If the player falls below that position, kill them and restart the level.
